    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-10-1_title = H1000-1152 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-10-1_description = The biggest hydrogen tank available from Argyle Hydroponics has a truly staggering volume, however, it's actually pretty light for the size. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-10-1_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo

    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-1_title = H375-144 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-1_description = The Mondo line of hydrogen tanks from Argyle is, as the name would suggest, monstrous. They all use insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-1_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-2_title = H375-72 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-2_description = Demand for a half-sized Mondo tank was high, so the Mondo-30 was created. It is slightly less high. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-2_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-3_title = H375-36 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-3_description = The smallest model in the Mondo line looks a little crumpled, but is perfectly serviceable. It also uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-375-3_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo

    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-1_title = H250-64 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-1_description = The medium Argyle tank line is nothing special. In fact, it didn't even get an eye-catching name! However, it still uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-1_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-2_title = H250-32 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-2_description = Middle of the road size, middle of the road capacity, middle of the road price, heck, even found in the middle of the road! Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-2_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-3_title = H250-16 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-3_description = Moderate diameter and a short height give the HI-M-5 an almost disappointingly low capacity. But! It uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank, so that's something.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-25-3_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo

    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-125-1_title = H125-8 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-125-1_description = The almost-new look of this tank is slightly suspicious, given that it was sent to the KSC new in the package. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-125-1_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-125-2_title =H125-4 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-125-2_description = The smallest stackable tank for storing liquid hydrogen isn't the most popular of tanks. It uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-125-2_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo

    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-125-1_title = HR-1 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-125-1_description = Affectionately known as the 'happy birthday tank' among the KSC staff. Responsible for 57 injuries when an engineer attempted to use a filled article as a cake - complete with candles. Due to regressions in plumbing technology, you may need to run a fuel line from this tank to get its "fuel" potential. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-125-1_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-25-1_title = HR-18 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-25-1_description = A large liquid hydrogen tank. Not particularly solid, but critic reviews include the words "stunning", "enormous" and "leaky". Wait, was I supposed to say that? Due to regressions in plumbing technology, you may need to run a fuel line from this tank to get its "fuel" potential. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-25-1_tags = fueltank oxidizer propellant rocket hydrogen cryo
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-375-1_title = HR-64 Hydrogen Tank
    #LOC_CryoTanks_hydrogen-radial-375-1_description = This tank was conceived when Argyle's lead engineer accidentally doubled the radius on the blueprints of the HB-8. After several dozen were built and met with critcal acclaim, it was slated for mass production. Due to regressions in plumbing technology, you may need to run a fuel line from this tank to get its "fuel" potential. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
