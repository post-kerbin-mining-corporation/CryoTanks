=================
Cryo Tanks v1.6.6
=================

A mod pack for Kerbal Space Program, specifically supporting my other mods Kerbal Atomics (https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/KerbalAtomics) and Cryogenic Engines (https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CryoEngines), dealing with cryogenic fuels, their storage and their properties.

Generally, this mod introduces a new fuel, Liquid Hydrogen, which can be consumed by specific engines. It is a temperamental fuel that slowly evaporates (boils off) from improperly cooled tanks. The boiloff rate is quite low so there is only a need to deal with it if you are storing fuel on orbit or doing long interplanetary transfers.

Firstly, the mod adds patches that enables fuel switching on most parts, stock and modded, that contain LiquidFuel/Oxidizer. The parts will be able to contain the following fuel settings with correct dry masses:
- LiquidFuel/Oxidizer
- LqdHydrogen/Oxidizer
- LiquidFuel
- Oxidizer
- LqdHydrogen

In addition, it adds several zero boiloff (ZBO) tanks that use electricity to halt boiloff. These are provided in 1.25m to 5m size classes as well as several radial mount models. They have the same mass properties, but take less power to cool.
